# WDD331R-ZEN-GARDEN
The Css Zen Garden is a project started over 10 years ago to show the power and potential of CSS in web design. It's premise was simple: if you take a single html file, how many different ways could it be styled without modifying the html.

Over the course of the semester we will be creating our own versions of the Zen Garden as a group project.
